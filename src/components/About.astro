  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Born and raised on Florida's Space Coast, I was encouraged to reach for the stars. Even though I had obtained a degree in Psychology, I found excitement while working at Kennedy Space Center and Department of Defense sites.</p>
  <p>As a native Floridian, I was considerably affected by the retirement of the Space Shuttle program several years ago. However, I went on to embrace employment opportunities elsewhere, ultimately deciding to launch a new career as a software engineer.</p>
